### Key Features
🧠 Smart Unit Finder: Skip the manual configuration. Type natural queries like "How heavy is a bowling ball?" or "Area of a tennis court," and UnitAI will automatically find the value, set the correct category, and configure the units for you.

🌍 Universal Context: Converting miles to kilometers is easy; understanding the scale is harder. UnitAI generates vivid, real-life comparisons—such as equating a distance to the height of the Eiffel Tower or the length of a blue whale—to help you visualize the magnitude.

⚡ Pro-Grade Conversion Engine: Support for six essential categories: Distance, Weight, Volume, Area (including square footage), Speed, and Temperature. Swap between US Customary and the International System (Metric) with a single tap.

📱 Mobile-First Design: Optimized for on-the-go use with a compact, thumb-friendly interface. Whether you're on a construction site, in the kitchen, or traveling abroad, the results you need stay front and center without unnecessary scrolling.

✨ AI Insights: Every conversion comes with a "Did You Know?" fact—fascinating snippets of information about the scale of your measurement, powered by real-time AI analysis.
UnitAI transforms math into meaning, making the world’s measurements instantly relatable.
